- [ ] [T4] backend/app/utils/elapsed_bucket.py — Delete the file as it is a duplicate implementation with zero callers outside its test. VERIFY: `test ! -f backend/app/utils/elapsed_bucket.py && echo "deleted"`. (cat:refactor; multifile:yes)

- [ ] [T3] backend/app/utils/dashboard_metrics.py — Import `duration_bucket` and update `calculate_dashboard_summary()` to compute `duration_distribution` using `duration_bucket.distribution(durations)` and include it in the returned summary dict. VERIFY: `pytest backend/tests/test_dashboard_metrics.py::test_summary_includes_distribution -v`. (cat:python; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T2] backend/tests/test_dashboard_metrics.py — Add a test asserting that `calculate_dashboard_summary()` returns a `duration_distribution` key with correct counts for a known input list. VERIFY: `pytest backend/tests/test_dashboard_metrics.py::test_summary_includes_distribution -v`. (cat:test; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T3] backend/app/routers/test_runs.py — Ensure the `get_dashboard_summary` endpoint response schema or serialization explicitly includes the `duration_distribution` field from the service layer.
