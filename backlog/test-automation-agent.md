- [ ] [T1] backend/tests/test_auth_router.py — Add a test that mocks the logger and asserts that the logged message contains the masked email format (e.g., `j***@example.com`) instead of the raw email upon user signup. VERIFY: python -m pytest backend/tests/test_auth_router.py::test_signup_logs_masked_email -v. (cat:test; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T1] backend/tests/test_email_service.py — Add a test that mocks the logger and asserts that the logged message contains the masked email format when SMTP is not configured.

(cat:python; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T4] backend/app/routers/auth.py — Ensure the `mask_email` import is correctly resolved and does not cause circular imports by checking the module dependency graph.

- [ ] [T4] backend/tests/test_notification_dispatcher.py — Create new test file to mock `asyncio.sleep` and assert it is called with a jittered value (not the exact base delay) when retries occur.
