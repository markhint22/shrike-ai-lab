- [ ] [T1] backend/tests/test_event_pattern.py — Remove the test file for the deleted utility to prevent import errors and maintain test suite integrity. VERIFY: `test ! -f backend/tests/test_event_pattern.py`. (cat:test; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T2] backend/app/utils/__init__.py — Ensure no explicit imports of `event_pattern` or `event_matches` remain in the package initialization to avoid import failures after deletion. VERIFY: `grep -q "event_pattern" backend/app/utils/__init__.py && exit 1 || exit 0`. (cat:python; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T3] backend/app/services/notification_dispatcher.py — Verify that the local `event_matches` function at line 33 remains intact and is the sole implementation used by the dispatcher, confirming no dependency on the deleted utility. VERIFY: `grep -n "def event_matches" backend/app/services/notification_dispatcher.py | grep -q "33:" && python -m pytest backend/tests/test_notification_dispatcher.py::test_event_matches_catch_all -v`. (cat:python; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T4] backend/app — Execute a global search to confirm zero remaining references to `utils.event_pattern` or `from app.utils.event_pattern` across the entire codebase. VERIFY: `grep -rn "utils.event_pattern\|from app.utils.event_pattern" backend/ --include="*.py" | wc -l | grep -q "^0$"`. (cat:refactor; multifile:yes)
- [ ] [T5] backend — Run the full backend test suite to ensure no regressions occurred from removing the dead code and that the wired notification dispatcher tests pass. VERIFY: `cd backend && python -m pytest --tb=short -q`. (cat:test; multifile:yes)

# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-19]: Wire `throughput.tests_per_minute()` into the dashboard summary, following the exact prece (review + tweak) ---
- [ ] [T1] backend/app/utils/dashboard_metrics.py — Add `tests_per_minute` calculation logic inside `calculate_dashboard_summary()` using `total_passed + total_failed + total_skipped` and total duration, importing `tests_per_minute` from `backend.app.utils.throughput`. VERIFY: `python -m pytest backend/tests/test_utils_dashboard_metrics.py -v` passes with new assertions for throughput field. (cat:python; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T2] backend/tests/test_utils_dashboard_metrics.py — Add unit tests for the new `tests_per_minute` field in the dashboard summary response, covering zero-duration and normal cases. VERIFY: `python -m pytest backend/tests/test_utils_dashboard_metrics.py::test_dashboard_summary_includes_throughput -v` passes. (cat:test; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T3] backend/app/routers/test_runs.py — Update `get_dashboard_summary` endpoint response model or dict construction to include the `tests_per_minute` field from the service layer. VERIFY: `python -m pytest backend/tests/test_routers_test_runs.py -v` passes and API response includes `tests_per_minute`. (cat:endpoint; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T4] backend/app/schemas/dashboard.py — Add `tests_per_minute: float` field to the `DashboardSummaryResponse` Pydantic model if a schema file exists, or update the inline response model in `test_runs.py`. VERIFY: `python -c "from backend.app.schemas.dashboard import DashboardSummaryResponse; print(DashboardSummaryResponse.model_fields.keys())"` includes `tests_per_minute`. (cat:schema; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T5] backend/app/utils/dashboard_metrics.py — Ensure `calculate_dashboard_summary` handles edge cases where total duration is zero by returning 0.0 for `tests_per_minute` to prevent division errors, leveraging the zero-safe `tests_per_minute` util. VERIFY: `python -m pytest backend/tests/test_utils_dashboard_metrics.py::test_dashboard_summary_zero_duration -v` passes. (cat:python; multifile:no)
