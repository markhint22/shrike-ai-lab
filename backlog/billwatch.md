- [ ] [T2] billwatch-backend/app/routers/articles.py — Add `Depends(get_current_user)` to the `/rank` endpoint (assuming file exists or create if missing based on feature description, but layout shows `article_relevance.py`; checking layout: `billwatch-backend/app/routers/article_relevance.py` is present. The feature says `POST /api/articles/rank`. I will assume the route is in `article_relevance.py` or a new `articles.py`. Given the layout has `article_relevance.py`, I will target that if it contains the rank endpoint, or create `articles.py`. Let's look at the layout: `billwatch-backend/app/routers/article_relevance.py` exists. The feature mentions `POST /api/articles/rank`. I will add the dependency to the relevant endpoint in `article_relevance.py` or create a new router if it's distinct. To be safe and precise, I will target `billwatch-backend/app/routers/article_relevance.py` assuming it hosts article-related POSTs, or if `articles.py` is not in layout, I must use existing paths. Wait, the layout does NOT have `articles.py`. It has `article_relevance.py`. I will assume the endpoint is there or I need to create `articles.py`. The prompt says "Use ONLY real paths consistent with the layout above". If `articles.py` doesn't exist, I should probably modify `article_relevance.py` if that's where it lives, or the feature implies a new file. However, usually "rank" is part of relevance. Let's assume the endpoint is in `article_relevance.py`. If not, I cannot invent a path. Let's look closer. `billwatch-backend/app/routers/article_relevance.py` is there. I will add auth to the POST endpoint in that file. VERIFY: `grep -q "Depends(get_current_user)" billwatch-backend/app/routers/article_relevance.py`.
