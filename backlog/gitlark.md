# gitlark — pre-decomposed release-polish backlog (27B-friendly)
# queue_refill.py pulls [T1-T5] items from here into OVERNIGHT_PROGRESS.md when doable is low.
# Note: gitlark web is Vue 3 + Pinia (not React).


# --- gitlark deepen (2026-09-04): release-blockers first (Terms page, validation, error states, WCAG) ---

# --- next-year roadmap decomposition (2026-09-05): usage-insights coverage + deprecated-model guards + reliability ---

# --- gitlark v2 (2026-09-05): planner/dispatcher pure helpers + PWA component tests ---

# gitlark control-plane pure helpers (2026-09-05)
