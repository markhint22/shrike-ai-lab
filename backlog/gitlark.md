# gitlark — pre-decomposed release-polish backlog (27B-friendly)
# queue_refill.py pulls [T1-T5] items from here into OVERNIGHT_PROGRESS.md when doable is low.
# Note: gitlark web is Vue 3 + Pinia (not React).


# --- gitlark deepen (2026-09-04): release-blockers first (Terms page, validation, error states, WCAG) ---

# --- next-year roadmap decomposition (2026-09-05): usage-insights coverage + deprecated-model guards + reliability ---

# --- gitlark v2 (2026-09-05): planner/dispatcher pure helpers + PWA component tests ---

# gitlark control-plane pure helpers (2026-09-05)

# --- refill 2026-09-06: plan/dispatch-domain pure modules (self-verifying, T1-T2) ---

# --- COMPETITIVE 2026-09-06: Gitlark vs GitHub Mobile — beyond-triage review + Agent Connectors (the validated portfolio gap) ---
# Beyond-triage: GitHub Mobile is read/comment/approve-only, chokes on >300-file PRs, can't run tests
# Agent Connectors: nobody targets external CLI agents (Claude Code, aider, cursor) from a phone — Replit is in-house only

# --- Claude-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-22]: connector_credentials.py create/update encrypt() signature bug + real DB persistence — backend/app/routers/connector_credentials.py (fresh live-code audit, roadmap's own earlier item on this file was stale — router IS mounted and list/get/update/delete already query the real DB; only create() is still a full mock and both create+update call encryption_service.encrypt() with swapped/wrong-typed args) ---

# --- Claude-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-22]: dead/orphaned service + stray-file cleanup sweep (fresh live-code audit, each confirmed zero-caller via grep against the current tree — several superseded roadmap items from 2026-09-14/17/18/19 turned out to already be fixed by the fleet, this batch is a fresh re-scan, not a recycled description) ---

# --- Claude-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-22]: get_repo_context() ignores its own workspace_id parameter — cross-workspace repo-analysis data leak — backend/app/services/repo_context.py (verified live: the SQL query has no WHERE clause on workspace at all, it always returns whichever repo was analyzed most recently system-wide) ---

# --- Claude-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-22]: OtaService is fully unwired mock scaffolding — web/src/services/ota.ts (parseCapgoUpdateResponse/shouldApplyUpdate are already tested pure functions, but OtaService.initialize() fakes a hardcoded newer version and is never called by any component in web/src) ---

# --- Claude-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-22]: re-added with corrected VERIFY commands — 7 items from the connector_credentials/dead-orphan-cleanup/repo_context features above were pulled with backwards-logic grep VERIFY commands (checking PRESENCE of the code-to-be-removed, or PRESENCE of a substring that already existed in a stale comment, instead of its ABSENCE) and got instantly, wrongly pre-verify-credited without a single real 27B cycle touching the file. Reverted those 7 false credits in OVERNIGHT_DONE.md; these are the same 7 fixes with corrected VERIFY logic ---

# --- Claude-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-22 round 3]: ControlPlaneAgent chat wiring computes tool_calls but discards them — no execute_tool_call(), no response message ever appended (undoes part of the 2026-09-20 "Finish P5" claim) ---
