- [ ] [T2] backend/tests/test_cleanup_garbage.py — Add a test that asserts the 8 garbage files are not present in the working directory after cleanup. VERIFY: `pytest backend/tests/test_cleanup_garbage.py -v` passes. (cat:test; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T3] .gitignore — Add patterns to prevent future LLM chat fragments from being tracked (e.g., `*.chat`, `aider.*`). VERIFY: `grep -q "aider" .gitignore` returns 0. (cat:refactor; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T4] backend/scripts/pre_commit_check.py — Create a pre-commit hook script that rejects commits containing files with spaces or LLM-like names in the root. VERIFY: `python backend/scripts/pre_commit_check.py "Is there a bug in \`delivery.py\`?"` exits with non-zero status. (cat:python; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T5] .pre-commit-config.yaml — Configure pre-commit to run the garbage file check on all staged files. VERIFY: `pre-commit run --all-files` passes without errors. (cat:refactor; multifile:yes)
