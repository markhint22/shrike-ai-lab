# xlite — RELEASE-READINESS backlog (27B-friendly GDScript/GUT), release-blockers FIRST
# TOP blockers: crash guards (corrupt save_version) + economy bugs (negative spend grants credits)
# + soft-lock guards. battle.gd and mission_select.gd are HARD-BANNED for the fleet (Claude only).

# --- next-year roadmap decomposition (2026-09-05): tutorial + content expansion + release ---

# --- platform-completion pure-logic (2026-09-05): desktop/mobile/steam helpers + tests ---

# --- refill (2026-09-05): pure-logic coverage + new testable helper modules (not battle.gd/mission_select.gd) ---

# --- refill 2026-09-06: new self-contained pure GDScript modules + GUT tests (landable) ---

# --- refill 2026-09-06: more pure GDScript modules + GUT tests (self-verifying) ---

# --- COMPETITIVE 2026-09-06: xlite vs Into the Breach — telegraphed enemy intents (their signature) + no-pay-to-wait ---
# Full-information / telegraphed enemy moves — the defining Into the Breach feature xlite lacks



# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-07]: Telegraphed enemy intents (Into-the-Breach signature): planned target, threat overlay, int (review + tweak) ---

# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-07]: Wire pure combat predicates into battle.gd (suppression, overwatch, flanking, friendly-fir (review + tweak) ---
- [ ] [T2] test/battle/test_overwatch.gd — Write unit test for `overwatch.gd` verifying true when LOS is clear and range valid, false when blocked. VERIFY: `godot --headless -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://test/battle/test_overwatch.gd`. (cat:test; multifile:no)

# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-08]: Save/load hardening + settings + UX polish {cat: game; size: M; multifile: yes; research:  (review + tweak) ---

# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-10]: Fog-of-war follow-through (base is done, this is the remainder): (1) land the patrol-enemy (review + tweak) ---
# NOTE (2026-09-10): the planner decomposed this from the SERVER's overnight/feature clone, which didn't
# yet have the patrol-AI work that already shipped on claude/feature -> develop (_enemy_can_see_a_player/
# _patrol_step in battle.gd, MissionData.enemy_patrol_routes, tests/test_battle_patrol.gd,
# tests/test_mission_data_patrol_route.gd - all real and tested). Removed 7 duplicate items that would
# have rebuilt the same feature as new patrol_ai.gd/enemy_sight-adjacent files once overnight/feature
# catches up to develop. Kept only the genuinely still-open piece: per-archetype sight range - but split
# so the fleet only gets the standalone-file half; battle.gd is in .queue-hard-banned-files (mechanical
# enforcement in run_overnight.sh discards the WHOLE cycle if a commit touches it), so wiring
# EnemySight.get_range into battle.gd's actual usage site is Claude-only, noted in OVERNIGHT_PROGRESS.md's
# hard-ban section instead of left here where the fleet would burn a guaranteed-discarded cycle on it.

# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-10]: Mission variety + campaign arc — Adopt Into the Breach's model: a small fixed set of ~6 ob (review + tweak) ---

# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-10]: Roster depth: classes, abilities, synergy, upgrades — Ship 4-6 mechanically distinct class (review + tweak) ---

# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-10]: Desktop release (Steam/itch) prep — Steam: create Steamworks account, pay the $100 Steam D (review + tweak) ---

# --- 27B-decomposed from roadmap [2026-09-10]: Mobile port (Android first) — touch controls, safe-area — Remap desktop trackpad pinch-zoo (review + tweak) ---
- [ ] [T1] scripts/battle/touch_move.gd — Add static function `validate_move_target(cell: Vector2i, unit_pos: Vector2i, move_range: int, obstacles: Array[Vector2i]) -> bool` that checks if a tapped cell is within range and not blocked, for tap-to-move logic. VERIFY: `godot --headless -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://tests/unit/test_touch_move.gd -gexit` passes with grid pathfinding edge cases. (cat:godot; multifile:no)
