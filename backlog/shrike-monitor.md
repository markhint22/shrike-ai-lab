# shrike-monitor — RELEASE-READINESS backlog (27B-friendly), release-blockers FIRST
# TOP blocker: heartbeat monitors never report "down" when overdue (status endpoint uses
# summarize_status for all types). The first 3 items fix that.

- [ ] [T1] backend/app/services/checker.py — Remove the `resolve_checker_dependencies()` function definition spanning lines 88-108. VERIFY: `grep -n "def resolve_checker_dependencies" backend/app/services/checker.py` returns no output. (cat:refactor; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T2] backend/tests/test_checker_import.py — Add a test case asserting that `resolve_checker_dependencies` is not present in the `checker` module namespace. VERIFY: `pytest backend/tests/test_checker_import.py -v` passes. (cat:test; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T3] backend/app/services/checker.py — Verify no other functions in the module reference `resolve_checker_dependencies` via introspection or direct call. VERIFY: `grep -rn "resolve_checker_dependencies" backend/` returns no output. (cat:refactor; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T4] backend/tests/test_core.py — Ensure existing core integration tests still pass after the removal to confirm no hidden dependencies. VERIFY: `pytest backend/tests/test_core.py -v` passes. (cat:test; multifile:no)
- [ ] [T5] backend/app/services/__init__.py — Confirm that `checker` module imports remain valid and do not expose the removed function if it was previously re-exported. VERIFY: `python -c "from backend.app.services import checker; assert not hasattr(checker, 'resolve_checker_dependencies')"` exits with code 0. (cat:refactor; multifile:no)
