# Grooming proposal — shrike-monitor — 2026-09-09 04:00

## Current Next Steps
```
- [x] [T1] Add tests for `Monitor.to_dict` and `CheckResult.to_dict` in backend/app/models.py (round-trip all fields)
- [x] [T1] Add tests for `classify_http` boundary in backend/app/models.py (latency exactly == degraded_latency_ms -> degraded; a None latency but ok -> up)
- [x] (already-satisfied in code, implement-verified) [T2] Add tests for `heartbeat_overdue` boundary in backend/app/models.py (now exactly at interval+grace -> not overdue; one second past -> overdue)
- [x] (already-satisfied in code, implement-verified) [T2] Add a `worst_status` helper in backend/app/models.py returning the worst of a list of statuses (down>degraded>up>pending) + tests
- [x] (already-satisfied in code, implement-verified) [T2] Add a `latency_stats` helper in backend/app/models.py (min/avg/max/p95 over the ok results' latency_ms, ignoring None) + tests
- [x] [T2] Add a `consecutive_failures` helper in backend/app/models.py (count trailing non-ok results) + tests
- [x] (already-satisfied in code, implement-verified) [T2] Add a `should_alert` helper in backend/app/models.py (True when consecutive_failures >= a threshold, transitioning up->down) + tests
- [x] [T1] Add validation to `MonitorCreate` in backend/app/schemas.py requiring url to be non-empty when type=="http" (model validator) + a test
- [x] [T1] Add a `pattern`/scheme check that http monitor urls start with http:// or https:// in backend/app/schemas.py + a test
- [x] [T2] Add tests for `Store.results` limit argument and empty-monitor behavior in backend/app/store.py
- [x] (already-satisfied in code, implement-verified) [T2] Add a `Store.record_probe` convenience that records + trims, and a `Store.latest(monitor_id)` returning the most recent result or None, in backend/app/store.py + tests
- [ ] [AUTO-SKIP after 4 failed-to-land cycles — kept reverting (already-done, too hard for the 27B, or a sibling-file gate fail); review — NOT necessarily human-only] [HUMAN] [T1] backend/app/main.py — pass a description and license_info to FastAPI(...) for a complete OpenAPI doc. VERIFY: GET /openapi.json → json["info"]["description"] is a non-empty string. (polish:docs)
```

## Proposed (LLM re-evaluation — review before applying)
1. Add a `description` and `license_info` to the FastAPI instance in `backend/app/main.py` to complete the OpenAPI documentation metadata.
2. Implement a `GET /health` endpoint in `backend/app/main.py` that returns a simple JSON status object for load balancer health checks.
3. Add unit tests for the `Store.record_probe` method in `backend/tests/test_store.py` to verify data trimming logic when result limits are exceeded.
4. Create a `GET /api/v1/monitors/{id}/summary` endpoint in `backend/app/routers/monitors.py` that aggregates current status and recent latency stats using existing model helpers.
5. Add integration tests for the `/health` endpoint in `backend/tests/test_core.py` to ensure it returns 200 OK and valid JSON structure.
