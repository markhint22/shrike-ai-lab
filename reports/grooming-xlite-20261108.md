# Grooming proposal — xlite — 2026-11-08 04:00

## Current Next Steps
```
- [x] [AUTO-SKIP after 5 no-op cycles — already-done, mis-targeted, or beyond the 27B; review] [EMERGENCY][T2] godot GUT suite is RED — TRIAGE then FIX: decide whether the CODE is wrong (fix the code) or the TEST is stale/flaky (fix or update the test), then get the whole suite green. Failing:   Failing         4;[31m---- 4 failing tests ---- ERROR: 12 RID allocations of type 'PN13RendererDummy14TextureStorage12DummyTextureE' were leaked at exit.;ERROR: 93 RID allocations of type 'PN18TextServerAdvanced22ShapedTextDataAdvancedE' were leaked at exit. ERROR: 1 RID allocations of type 'PN18TextServerAdvanced12FontAdvancedE' were leaked at exit.  <!-- superseded by recovery decomposition below -->
- [x] (dismissed 2026-10-07: diagnostic note, not a work item - the underlying work is tracked by the item lines with a VERIFY clause) [CLAUDE] this area has been recovered/decomposed 5 times (cap 2) without ever landing - the fleet keeps re-guessing at this same file with no real diagnosis; needs a human/Claude session to understand the actual blast radius (recovery:escalated)
```

## Proposed (LLM re-evaluation — review before applying)
1. Verify GUT test suite is green and confirm RID leak errors are resolved by running the full test suite locally.
2. Implement unit tests for the new BackNav utility to ensure back navigation input detection works correctly.
3. Add a validation script to verify that all rig_meta.json files in assets/sprites/rig_units/ reference existing sprite assets.
4. Create a documentation snippet in README.md explaining how to add new enemy units using the existing rig structure.
5. Refactor the set_binding guard logic to extract validation into a separate utility function for better testability.
